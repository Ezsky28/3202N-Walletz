# Create a simple CRUD web application that has at least 3 pages:

- Login
- Dashboard
- Any page of your preference

## The application must have a login/logout feature that will utilize JWT (JSON Web Tokens):

- generate an access token and a refresh token during login
- use the access token for accessing authenticated routes in your application
- use the refresh token for requesting a new access token if it expires
- invalidate/revoke the tokens when the user logs out

## For testing, the application must have the following:

- automation testing for the front-end
- unit testing for the back end

## Only add tests for the main features of your application. Make sure that the tests cover all possible scenarios of your feature.

## The application must also be deployed (there is no preferred hosting service, use whatever you like).

## Submission Requirements

### Submit the following here in canvas:

- Git repository. Each member must have at least 20%-25% of code contributed to the project.
- Link to the deployed application. Both front end and back end (this is for the API endpoints)
- Screenshots of the application being opened in the browser with the network tab opened showing the request and response to and from the deployed servers.
- A sheet of all the test scenarios used in for automation and unit testing (refer to your notes on writing test scenarios).
 

## Note: There is no limitation on the tech stacks that you can use. Feel free to use any technology you prefer.
